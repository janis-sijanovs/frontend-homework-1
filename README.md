# Frontend Homework 1

I have completed my first homework. I'm not sure how good my class names are. 
They are quite long, but that's the way I felt it would be the most descriptive, and I think it would follow BEM.

I think I did everything correctly. The few things I'm not sure about are:

   - There was a button, which had 400 font-weight, but 500 in hover and active. 
   Similar buttons were 500 font-weight too, so I assumed it's better than all are 400.
   
   - The "Add" button had a double gradient on the border, and I couldn't figure out a way to make it work.

   - In many places, I used pixels, which are not great for responsivity but allow me to better fit the layout to the design. 
   I do think that it's fine in this assignment and the way I used them.
